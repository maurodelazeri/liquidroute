This document provides a technical overview of permissionless decentralized exchanges (DEXs) operating on the Solana blockchain that support token swaps. It details their trading algorithms, internal mechanics, and protocol-specific considerations. This information is compiled for building an ultra-low latency, cutting-edge swap aggregator directly integrated with Solana validator infrastructure.

## Project Vision: Next-Generation Solana-Only Aggregator

The objective is to build the most optimized, lowest-latency, and technologically advanced swap aggregator ever created on Solana. Key principles:

1. **Ultra-Low Latency**: Deep integration with Solana validator infrastructure (beyond Geyser)
2. **Completely Open Source**: All code will be public and auditable
3. **Zero Added Fees**: Passing through only protocol-native fees
4. **Solana-Native Design**: Not a cross-chain solution - optimized specifically for Solana's architecture
5. **Novel Technical Approaches**: May require inventing new methodologies for optimal performance

This document serves as the foundational technical reference to understand the internal mechanics of each protocol before building innovative integration approaches.

### Protocol Implementation Details and Low-Latency Considerations

## 1. Raydium

**Protocol Architecture and Internal Mechanics:**

    - Liquidity Program: `27haf8L6oxUeXrHrgEgsexjSY5hbVUWEmvv9Nyxg8vQv`
    - Farm Program: `EhhTKczWMGQt46ynW3iUNjF3uHecGY9WsB2naaEZU3Vh`
- **Automated Market Maker (AMM):** Raydium employs the Constant Product Market Maker model using the following approach:
    
    **Formula Implementation:**
    
    ```
    x * y = k
    
    ```
    
    **Internal Execution Flow:**
    
    1. Protocol validates input token accounts
    2. Computes target output amount using constant product formula
    3. Transfers input tokens to pool
    4. Transfers output tokens to user with adjusted slippage
    5. Updates pool state with new token balances
    
    *Low-Latency Considerations:*
    
    - Computation is deterministic and can be predicted client-side
    - Pool state data accounts are heavily accessed - prioritize prefetching
    - Consider subscribing to state changes for real-time updates
- **OpenBook-v2 Integration:**
    
    **Integration Architecture:**
    
    1. Raydium maintains special AMM accounts tied to OpenBook-v2 markets
    2. Price matching happens in two stages:
        - First checks available liquidity on OpenBook-v2
        - Then supplements with AMM liquidity if needed
    3. Trading is executed atomically through a combined CPI instruction
    
    *Low-Latency Considerations:*
    
    - Critical to monitor both AMM state accounts and OpenBook-v2 order books
    - Creates unique arbitrage opportunities between AMM and CLOB pricing
    - Validator-level integration could detect these price discrepancies immediately

**Program Account Structure:**

```
- Config Account: Stores protocol parameters and fee settings
- Pool State Accounts: Stores token pair data, reserves, and LP token data
- Pool LP Accounts: Acts as custodian for LP tokens
- Temporary accounts: Created during swaps for atomic execution

```

**Protocol-Specific Optimizations:**

- Fast price calculations require direct access to the latest pool reserves
- Oracle price feeds can be used for price sanity checks
- For validator-level integration, subscribe to account state changes for both Raydium pools and associated OpenBook-v2 markets
- Possible to predict price impacts with high accuracy using current state

    2. Tick system implements discrete price points, each representing a 0.01% price change
    3. Active liquidity only includes positions where current price is within range
    4. Price updates trigger a cascading recalculation of tick states:
        - Cross events activate/deactivate liquidity positions
        - Fee accrual is tracked per position, not globally
    
    **Technical Execution Flow:**
    
    1. Protocol identifies active ticks and calculates available liquidity
